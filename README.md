# ü§ñ AI_Case_Studies
A collection of AI projects exploring various Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementations and approaches. This repository showcases different techniques, models, and frameworks for building effective RAG systems.
# üìö Project Overview
This repository contains four distinct projects exploring different aspects of RAG technology, from frontend applications to core RAG implementations using various models and techniques.
# üß† RAG Exam Helper
A full-stack application combining React frontend with LangChain RAG backend to analyze and provide feedback on exam papers.
Key Technologies:

LangChain for RAG pipeline orchestration
Flask API backend
FAISS vector storage
React + Vite frontend
Document chunking for improved semantic search

This project demonstrates the powerful integration of modern frontend development with intelligent document processing, creating an interactive tool for exam paper analysis.
# üìö Alice in Wonderland Exam Grader
An advanced grading system that evaluates exam responses based on the classic novel "Alice in Wonderland" using local LLM integration.
Key Technologies:

Llama 3.2 local model integration via Ollama
Document processing and chunking
Multiple embedding options (local and API-based)
Intelligent query routing between vector store and web search
Retrieval grading techniques

This project showcases how local LLM deployment can be used for privacy-focused, high-quality assessment systems with no usage costs.
# üñºÔ∏è Image-to-Text Extraction with GPT-4o
A tool that utilizes OpenAI's multimodal capabilities to extract and process text from images with special handling for multilingual content.
Key Technologies:

OpenAI GPT-4o Vision API
Base64 image encoding
Structured response processing
Cost tracking and logging
Multilingual support (including Turkish character normalization)

This project demonstrates effective integration of vision AI capabilities for practical document processing tasks.
# üìÑ JSON to Text Extraction Utility
A specialized utility for converting complex nested JSON data structures into human-readable text files with preserved hierarchy.
Key Technologies:

Recursive JSON parsing
Batch file processing
Hierarchical formatting and indentation
Intelligent file organization
Robust error handling

This support tool helps in processing and analyzing structured data outputs from other AI systems.
# üîç Research Focus
These projects represent an exploration of different RAG approaches and technologies:

Models Explored: Llama 3.2 (local), OpenAI GPT models (API), HuggingFace open-source models
RAG Variations: Standard RAG, GRAG (Graded Retrieval-Augmented Generation), RAPTOR (Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval)
Frameworks: LangChain, direct API implementations, vector databases
Deployment Options: Local model inference, API-based services, hybrid approaches

# üöÄ Getting Started
Each project contains its own detailed README with setup instructions and usage examples. Navigate to the specific project directory to learn more about each implementation.
üå± Learning Journey
This repository documents my learning journey exploring different RAG technologies and implementation approaches. The projects demonstrate progression from basic RAG implementations to more complex systems incorporating grading, multimodal inputs, and specialized processing.
