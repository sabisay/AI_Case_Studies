This project uses OpenAI's Vision model (like gpt-4o) to extract structured data from images (e.g., scanned handwriting or printed documents) and calculate the estimated cost of the API usage.

Add your OpenAI API Key: Replace the empty string in the following line in main() with your actual key:

<pre>
    client = OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key-here")
</pre>
